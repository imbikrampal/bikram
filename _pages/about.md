Hello there! I'm Bikram, an aspiring Math major at [IISER Kolkata](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/) pursuing an integrated BS-MS in Mathematics and Statistics. This website is my personal space to share my academic adventures, research projects, and even some fun extracurricular pursuits.

## Current circumstances
I have a deep-rooted passion for mathematics and its myriad applications. Currently, my research is focused on turbulence and [non-linear partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation), inspired by my work on the [Navier-Stokes equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations) under the guidance of [Dr. Samriddhi Sankar Ray](https://www.icts.res.in/people/ssray) at the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences](https://www.icts.res.in/) in Bengaluru. I am also trying to understand [fractional calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_calculus) and [solitons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliton) under the guidance of [Dr. Uttam Ghosh](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=hfd7_kUAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [University of Calcutta](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/). My previous explorations in [computational stochastic processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process) at [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) under [Dr. Buddhananda Banerjee](https://sites.google.com/site/buddhanandastat/) have also enriched my understanding. Along with these, I enjoy delving into [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory), [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics), and [abstract algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra)—fields that continuously challenge and excite me.


## A Bit About Me
While my academic life keeps me busy, I’m also a full-time self-proclaimed Football Pundit and a huge fan of FC Barcelona. I’m an enthusiastic Flute Player and an avid Debater. I have a deep appreciation for music, with a taste that revolves around soulful Bengali songs and Bollywood classics—especially the mesmerizing voice of [Rahat Fateh Ali Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahat_Fateh_Ali_Khan). Besides mathematics and music, I am a foodie at heart! I take immense joy in exploring different cuisines, but nothing beats the delight of indulging in a plate full of [*rosogolla*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasgulla). If you ever want to have a conversation about math over some good food, I’m always up for it!


## Final Thoughts
This website is a living document of my ongoing journey. Just as research is never truly complete, this site is always under construction. I invite you to join me as I explore new challenges, share discoveries, and continuously evolve both academically and personally.

Enjoy your visit, and feel free to reach out for collaborations or a friendly chat!
