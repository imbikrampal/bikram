Hello there! I'm Bikram, an aspiring Math Major at IISER Kolkata pursuing an integrated BS-MS in Mathematics and Statistics. This website is my personal space to share my academic adventures, research projects, and even some fun extracurricular pursuits.

Current circumstances
======
I have a deep-rooted passion for mathematics and its myriad applications. Currently, my research is focused on turbulence and non-linear partial differential equations, inspired by my work on the Navier-Stokes equations under the guidance of Dr. Samriddhi Sankar Ray at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences in Bengaluru. I am also trying to understand fractional calculus and solilons under guidance of Dr. Uttam Ghosh at the University of Calcutta. My previous explorations in computational stochastic processes at IIT Kharagpur under Dr. Buddhananda Banerjee have also enriched my understanding. Along with these, I enjoy delving into number theory, combinatorics, and abstract algebra—fields that continuously challenge and excite me.

A Bit About Me
======
While my academic life keeps me busy, I’m also a full-time self-proclaimed Football Pundit, an enthusiastic Flute Player, and an avid Debater. I have a deep appreciation for music, with a taste that revolves around soulful Bengali songs and Bollywood classics—especially the mesmerizing voice of Rahat Fateh Ali Khan. Besides mathematics and music, I am a foodie at heart! I take immense joy in exploring different cuisines, but nothing beats the delight of indulging in a plate full of *rosogolla*. If you ever want to have a conversation about math over some good food, I’m always up for it!
